# Note
we could make our project with this magic library `anytree`
we have also installed graphviz to convert the DOT file to PNG image

but unfortunately it can render small amount of nodes, which is not what we need so for that we will handle visualization , serialization and deserialization by our own.
we can utilise the Node object for that
