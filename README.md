# About
this project is a way to make a tree structure for full directory where it categorizes files in it based on their extension.

it creates like a tree structure, it does not need to create a custom extension or a new extension it can just go with tree extensions like YAML, TOML, etc.

but i think YAML would be best choice, anyway

we also may make this as a services in background, and i dont know if we will build the tree file to be serialized and deserialized 

because i see no use for deserialization but we may benefit from it in the future

we have gave this project a silly name `lettree` because it is a tree LOL.
